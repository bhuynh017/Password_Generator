# Password_Generator

## Description
This project was to create a fully functional randomzied password generator. This will give the user an opportunity to create a completely random password based off what characters the user wants. This includes: special characters, letters of the alphabet (lower case and upper case) as well as numerically. The user will be prompted to select what they want for their password as soon as they click the "generate password" button and be prompted to choose what they want.

This was a great opportunity in learning how to utilize for loops and how to use your resources such as Google to create what the desired look and function of the website.

The blockers for this project included finding out how to utilize what was given and make it functional.
